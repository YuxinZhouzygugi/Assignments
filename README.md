# Assignments

All assignments will be listed here, along with due dates, and any required documentation. The four larger projects will also be listed here, but you will also receive a dedicated repo for those assignments.

### Week 1 - Due Monday, January 29th
Reading:
* Creative AI: [https://medium.com/@creativeai/creativeai-9d4b2346faf3](https://medium.com/@creativeai/creativeai-9d4b2346faf3) (please post response)<br/>
* (Recommended) What is AI & History: [Chapter 1 - Introduction - Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mperkows/CLASS_479/2017_ZZ_00/02__GOOD_Russel=Norvig=Artificial%20Intelligence%20A%20Modern%20Approach%20(3rd%20Edition).pdf)

Exercise:
* Get an input using more than two features (at least 3) into Wekinator working. Use the examples found in the [Wekinator Examples repo](https://github.com/artintelclass/wekinator_examples) to get started. You might find some other interesting OSC inputs [here](https://github.com/artintelclass/ml4a-ofx/tree/master/osc-modules). Using your inputs, train several classifiers in Wekinator. For example, if you're using a Face Tracker, maybe one class is mouth open, maybe another class is mouth closed, etc. After training, use your input running through Wekinator, sending out OSC to an output (like Processing). Make different things happen with each of your classes. (please post link to video of it working)

### Week 2 - Due Monday, February 5th
Reading:
* AI Revolution Parts [1](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) (please post response)

Exercises:
  * Play [Paperclips](http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/) Go as far (or not) as you want with it. (please post response)
  * Train and use a regression model in Wekinator. Have an input into Wekinator and then have multiple outputs into some other program. (post link to video of it working)
