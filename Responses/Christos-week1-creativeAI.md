Reading Respone on Creative AI:

After reading the article about Creative AI, I felt quite interested, as it gave a fantastic insight about technology and creativity throughout time. The first topic I would like to discuss about, is the escalation of creativity, which is an imaginary (at least for now world) where creativity is highly accessible to everyone and creativity is democratically shared among all people. Even if it would be wonderful for such a world to exist, I personally believe that it is impossible, as creativity comes from the minds of the artists and the only way it can be shared is via Artificial Intelligence in computers who can mimic the minds of great artists. However, this shared creativity in my opinion would not help in producing more artists or more creative people, as the AI would be responsible for the work and the not the humans themselves. The next topic I would like to comment is automation vs. augmentation and is also linked to the escalation of creativity which I talked about before. I personally believe that both automation and augmentation are important aspects for creativity as automation can help with the completion of repetitive tasks on the other hand as the writer mention augmentation is there to improve the artist's or the creator's capabilities. However, I believe that when these capabilities are improved to a large extend, then the AI or the tool that provided this augmentation could be also responsible for the art and the artist himself/herself, which is the same debate that I mentioned about the escalation of creativity. For that reason, I believe that technology and especially AI are wondeful tools to help us create art, but there should be a limit on how much they can assist, because then they can completely take over the artist's work.
