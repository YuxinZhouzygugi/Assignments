What is AI & History: [Chapter 1 - Introduction - Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mperkows/CLASS_479/2017_ZZ_00/02__GOOD_Russel=Norvig=Artificial%20Intelligence%20A%20Modern%20Approach%20(3rd%20Edition).pdf)

You can write your responses right here in this README, create another markdown document, provide a link to a blog, or however you wish, as long as I can access them from this repo.

I found the distinction between looking at progress/time linearly and exponentially to be really interesting. Now that I think about it more, I realize that it not only applies technological advancements over time but also to time attribution of projects. For my capstone, if I have to learn a skill, it takes more time but once I have acquired the skill, I am able to move at an accelerated pace by using that skill. It was also interesting to see that the tasks that are hard for to implement using AI are not the tasks that humans have to think about but the ones that we do without thinking. Replicating that would mean developing that cognitive backbone to support those decisions. I also found the distorted view of intelligence to be really interesting as when computers are able to equal the basic intelligence of humans and once they are able to do that, they will be able to reach Einstein level intelligence quickly. â€¨
