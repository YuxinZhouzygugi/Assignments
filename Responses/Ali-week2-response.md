AI Revolution Part 1:
A piece that amazes you, AI Revolution's part 1 made me feel how little I know about AI. I found myself guilty of being in the population that was heavily influenced by the sci-fi movies. The article starts out with an explanation of the Law of Accelerating Returns, a law I had never heard of. I often make the mistake of thinking 'linearly' and never thought in the lines of the 'exponential growth' phenomenon as explained in the law. I also didn't know that spam and ad recommendations are all AI, which is a testement to the fact that "after its implemented we no longer think its AI". The idea of 'breeding' computers was also mind-boggling, but it made sense after the explanation that followed. All in all, looking forward to reading Part 2.

Paperclip game:
I payed the game for 6 hours and even slept late because of it. It is very similar to games such as "Lemonade Tycoon" that Yahoo! Games developed. The AI in this game is trained to just make paperclips. So, it will do whatever is necessery to keep producing them, even potentially using humans as raw-material (I haven't reached that stage in the game).
