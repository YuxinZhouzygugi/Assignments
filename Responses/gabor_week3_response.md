In response to Part 2 of the AI revolution article I have mixed feelings about the uncertainty of the future. The article talked about concept that I myself have been thinking about for some time. First, the idea that our brain are just made up of small/big neural nets for every task we encounter. I imagine these neural nets to be rewirable and reprogrammable for new tasks and behaviours, but I guess we have only a limited amount of training time (youth) so we should make use of it. The other fascinating concept is how qualitative differences between intelligence levels are hard to imagine, but provide such an incredible evolutionary advantage. As the author explains, chimps can see skyscrapers, can see that humans are working around it, but will never be able to think on an abstract level that humans are building the skyscraper and in fact any animal could build it. This is why humans came to dominate and why humans will be dominated by AI or morphed into AI in a few decades. On the other hand, I didnâ€™t think of how artificial super intelligence (ASI) could potentially give us immortality. Moreover, I never had the crazy idea that since I will die anyways, my only chance to survive is ASI and therefore I should fight with all my energy to achieve it.
