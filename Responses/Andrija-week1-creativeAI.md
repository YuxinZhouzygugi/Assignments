# Readings Week 1

**Due before class starts Monday, January 29th.**

Read both of the following, and write a minimum 100-200 word response for each. We will discuss the readings in class on Monday.

What is AI & History: [Chapter 1 - Introduction - Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mperkows/CLASS_479/2017_ZZ_00/02__GOOD_Russel=Norvig=Artificial%20Intelligence%20A%20Modern%20Approach%20(3rd%20Edition).pdf)

You can write your responses right here in this README, create another markdown document, provide a link to a blog, or however you wish, as long as I can access them from this repo.

=======================RESPONSE============================================

So the first thing that struck me from this reading is an idea that I've come across while researching for my capstone: the notion that computers (tech in general) extend the way we think, represent, and associate. I've encountered this idea in musical context often in the case of hybird man-machine systems. The thinking goes that by establishing this interactive relationship, you shift your own creative processes and thoughts from a generative to a relational type of thinking, and this is not possible without the interaction afforded by a machine/computer. 

Again the narrative of my own research emerges in this context with the idea that from this collaboration between human and computer we get the "artist computer-scientist." 

I'm interested in the democratization that arises from the decreased skill acquisition afforded by computers. Is it completely good? Is something lost by relegating "technical skills." I guess what seems quite amazing to me is not to think about it in terms of, what's the value of art if everyone can make it and understand it. What is amazing is this idea that art loses maybe shifts from functional and aesthtic value to "empathetic communcative" tool. That seems super interesting to me. Creativity as a language to communciate the kind of abstract things that formal language cannot. 

Last thing: the shift to n-dimensional perspectives, and how it encourages a shift in thinking about design. Instead of designing objects, there is now the idea of designing processes, that in turn create objects within multiple contexts. Again, I think to my experience in music and ideas of algorithmic composition; where the product is not the final output, but the system you create to make that output. And I'm interested in the debate betwene how much of it is letting a machine do your work for you vs. your own output. Varese said: "don't expect miracles from machines. You'll only get out, what you put in."
