**Response**

Creative AI is a very informative and enlightening piece. I think it provides the perfect foundation to understanding the blend of AI and the creative process (and the history of this union), a blend which is the basis of this course. I never knew AI and its use to make so many of the tools used today can be traced back to mid last century. Starting from 'Memex', I feel it's amazing to know how people living decades ago, when there was no internet, thought of the things they thought of.

I liked the egalitarian idea of “technologies that allow more people to be more creative more of the time” or, simply put, “democratization of creativity” because  it seems very fair to me. Nowadays, with the prevalence of huge companies holding patents for almost every other thing, I sometimes feel like creativity is being harmed.

Another thing that I want to comment about is the debate that computers or AI might take over the world; I think we should rather focus on where the world has come to be because of computers. We would have been way back if we take them out of the equation for an instance. Music industry, photography, videography, cinema, communication, everything wouldn't have been nowhere close to where they are today.
