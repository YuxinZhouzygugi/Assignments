The second reading was, according to me, a bit more interesting than the first one. Although the first one did a good job of establishing the basics and explaining how it was all quite possible, the second one was actually the one that gave us a good idea of the magnitude of the issue at hand.

We saw a lot of the potential benefits of ASI. Medical, Environmental, IMMORTALITY!! all sounded like good things. But were they actually. As I had mentioned in my previous post, I dont think all these benefits are worth the risk. We could also face extinction if things dont go the way we planned. 
Although, I dont think we are ready for ASI right now, I dont think that we will never be. If we give enough time to ourselves, there will be a time when we will be ready for this kind of change - a change of the most dominant species on the planet.
Thus, on this issue, I side with Nick Bostrom, Elon Musk and other experts in various fields.
