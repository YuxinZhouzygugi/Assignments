What is AI & History: [Chapter 1 - Introduction - Artificial Intelligence a Modern Approach](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mperkows/CLASS_479/2017_ZZ_00/02__GOOD_Russel=Norvig=Artificial%20Intelligence%20A%20Modern%20Approach%20(3rd%20Edition).pdf)

You can write your responses right here in this README, create another markdown document, provide a link to a blog, or however you wish, as long as I can access them from this repo.


The article covers some of the concepts of creativity, particularly in relation to technology, and some of the recent trends affecting creativity. These trends included the lowered barrier to entry for creative tasks as a result of technology that can provide more assistance to the user, as well as easier and more frequent collaboration between people. In addition to this, the article introduced a conceptual framework for thinking about human-computer interactions, called the H-Metaphor. The H-Metaphor essentially proposes that humans and systems collaborate, much in the same way that humans do with horses, allowing for the more flexible and intuitive intelligence of humans to combine with the more structured intelligence of machines. The article also explains the importance of representation, and covers some of the ways in which generative methods will change the future of creativity. While interesting, some of the predictions may have been overly optimistic - for example, will machine suggestions during creative tasks inspire or inhibit creativity?
