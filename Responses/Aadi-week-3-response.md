The article makes an interesting distinction between the speed and quality of intelligence. While the article explains that an intelligent machine could quickly bypass humans, and the rate of its improvement would only increase, the article seems to overlook the role that hardware would play in this intelligence increase. Once the intelligence of the machine reaches a certain stage it is unlikely that the underlying hardware would be able to continue to support the machine. It may, however, be possible to use these new intelligent machines to devise new hardware that is more powerful than that created by humans. Even then, the rate at which intelligence improves would be capped by the rate at which hardware improves, rather than the theoretical maximum rate at which machine intelligence could improve.
