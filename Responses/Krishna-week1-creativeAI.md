READING RESPONSE 
______________________________________________________________________________
CreativeAI was a very interested read. There is a growing concern about AI and how it can take jobs away and eventually dominate us. However, this reading presents us with a different scenario. It shows ideas and examples on how AI can be used to democratize and accelerate creativity. 

I was very fascinated to read about how the definition of creativity has changed over time. Artists have used various tools throughout history to express themselves and create art. In the age of computers many artists have turned to computers (AI). In tomorrow's class I would like to discuss more about how the definition of creativity will change in the future. I think we are stepping into terrority where we are using computers to generate things that human beings can never imagine or never ever comprehend.
