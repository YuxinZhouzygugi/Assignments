It was a bitter sweet experience reading through the second part of the reading. AI could make us immortal and solve all world problems which is very exciting but at the same time it can kill all of us. I believe the writer when he says we are trying to anthropomorphize AI and think that it will have a thinking process similar to ours. It could not be farther from the truth. Trying to control a machine that has a fundamentally different way of thinking which we do not understand may lead to catastrophic problems. 

I am excited about both the future of AI and the nanotechnology but I am also frightened about what could happen if we took even a minute mis-step. We are living at very exciting times. I think we will achieve ASI within our lifetime and we will know for ourselves whether the ASI will kill all of us or take us towards immortality.
