Just like part 1, the article continued to enlighten me about the extent to which AI could go. The comparisons helped visualize the concept immensely; the juxtaposition of the intelligence of ants to humans made me realize how big a jump there is between us and the super-intelligent machines of the future. After reading the article I am a bit scared about the possible extinction of the human race by the hands of our own creation, but I feel like there is too much of sensationalism in this claim. 

It is true that after a certain level AI could get to an unimaginable level on its own, but the fact that there is no way that hardware could cope with this advancement is enough to reassure the survival of the human race to me. Thus, we should continue to advance in this field without any worries and make use of artificial intelligence in every field, and maybe one day use it to become immortal!
