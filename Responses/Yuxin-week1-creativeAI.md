-------------------------------------------------Response to Creative AI -----------------------------------------------------
 In ancient cultures, creativity was classified as a kind of discovery, but as the technology improves, people nowadays are able to explore deeper meaning that creativity contains. At the start of the article, the author came out with three new metaphors about creativity, including augmented creativity, Computational Creativity and Creative Systems, where new perspectives to discover creativity are provided. As computers and Internet are invented, the power of creativity started to accelerate exponentially. On the one hand, human’s creativity is improved through more highly effective leaning on computer. On the other hand, the creativity of tools is evolved since computer programs are able to assist human to create things they got much difficult to do with hands or other tools, such as painting programs help people to draw more perfect circle or generate fabulous and complicated fractals based on the repetition of shapes formed by simple rules. As the technology develops, more generative creations become true, and generative creation increases its influence. However, at the same time, people begin worry more about whether these creative machines will replace human and their works, while Creative AI’s the more intellectual capability intensifies their worries. The author’s attitude towards AI is that, “Creative AI is a question, rather than an answer. Its only demand is more collaboration and creativity. It is an invitation for play”, and I believe, as the broad definition of AI from “What is AI & History” describe, the term of AI can describe the artificial intelligence being able to think as a human, to act as a human, to think rationally, or to act rationally. That is to say, AI is created by human, and serve for human, human determines what is AI, and the key is to support the exploration that how to utilize AI’s talent in a better way instead of worrying any new things.
