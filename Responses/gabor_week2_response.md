After reading this line, the evolution of the human mind strikes me as a slow iterative learning process that optimizes our brains for the tasks that it is required to accomplish (, write, type…). Some ancient skills are optimized to the extent that we unconsciously do them with minimal training (walk, identify objects, recognize faces), but there are “modern” tasks that we are only in the process of figuring out. The problem is that as technology evolves with exponential speeds, our brains that need hundreds of thousands of years to adapt, will never catch up. The new goal of technology and human-computer interaction will be to adapt to human limitations and to augment them. The accelerating progress is also calling for a reformed education that is aimed at rapid learning. The paper clips game is trying to show us how unleashing AI can destroy humanity if left uncontrolled. Technology cannot advance infinitely fast without overtaking humanity is intelligence.

Souq.com wants to sort its packages by weight but they don’t have enough weighing scales. The CEO heard about this computer vision thing, and wants to make an algorithm that can eye the weight of each package. The camera would see one package at a time and has to guess the weight based on some training measurements.
